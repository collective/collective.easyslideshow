  successful in getting the selected folder to display its images in the

  that it gets run with the default profile instead of just an install.
  [cwainwright]

0.1 (2009-10-15)
----------------

- when easyslideshow is installed, slideshow_folder_view is made
  available from the display menu on a folder - on uninstall,
  slideshow_folder_view is removed from the display menu, and any
  folders using that view are reset to folder_listing
  [cwainwright]

- created an uninstall profile to remove the EasySlideshow Configuration
  from the control panel
  [cwainwright]

- added disclaimer about all images being the same size - fixed spacing
  on caption
  [cwainwright]

- changed the way the caption is positioned, so that it is always at the
  bottom of the slideshow container, no matter the image size - made the
  variable descriptions more descriptive
  [cwainwright]

- moved height and width variables to the template from CSS due to
  caching issues. 
  [cwainwright]
  
- added a control panel for the slideshow via Site Setup for easy
  customization functionality
  [cwainwright]

- cleaned up slideshow_macro code - set the slideshow to be hidden until
  everything is loaded (to avoid all slides being seen before the
  slideshow has loaded)
  [cwainwright]

- moved the stylesheet and JS to the skins directory so that the
  stylesheet can use dtml.  Also added dtml variables to the stylesheet
  so the slideshow will use colors set in base_properties.
  [cwainwright]

- fixed links to portal_url
  [cwainwright]

- make sure the index exists before searching/re-indexing
  [claytron]

- fixed interface path
  [claytron]
