  that it gets run with the default profile instead of just an install.
  [cwainwright]

0.1 (2009-10-15)
----------------

- when easyslideshow is installed, slideshow_folder_view is made
  available from the display menu on a folder - on uninstall,
  slideshow_folder_view is removed from the display menu, and any
  folders using that view are reset to folder_listing
  [cwainwright]

- created an uninstall profile to remove the EasySlideshow Configuration
  from the control panel
  [cwainwright]

- added disclaimer about all images being the same size - fixed spacing
  on caption
  [cwainwright]

  bottom of the slideshow container, no matter the image size - made the
  variable descriptions more descriptive
  [cwainwright]

  caching issues. 
  [cwainwright]

  everything is loaded (to avoid all slides being seen before the
  slideshow has loaded)
  [cwainwright]

  stylesheet can use dtml.  Also added dtml variables to the stylesheet
  so the slideshow will use colors set in base_properties.

  [cwainwright]

- make sure the index exists before searching/re-indexing
  [claytron]

  recursively

  [claytron]
